                            ASSIGNED NUMBERS

Status of this Memo

   This memo is a status report on the parameters (i.e., numbers and
   keywords) used in protocols in the Internet community.  Distribution
   of this memo is unlimited.

OVERVIEW

This RFC is a snapshot of the ongoing process of the assignment of
protocol parameters for the Internet protocol suite.  To make the
current information readily available the assignments are kept up-to-
date in a set of online text files.  This RFC has been assembled by
catinating these files together with a minimum of formatting "glue".
The authors appologize for the somewhat rougher formatting and style
than is typical of most RFCs.

We expect that various readers will notice specific items that should be
corrected.  Please send any specific corrections via email to
<iana@isi.edu>.

RFC 1700                    Assigned Numbers                October 1994


INTRODUCTION

The files in this directory document the currently assigned values for
several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.

        ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the central
coordinator for the assignment of unique parameter values for Internet
protocols.  The IANA is chartered by the Internet Society (ISOC) and
the Federal Network Council (FNC) to act as the clearinghouse to
assign and coordinate the use of numerous Internet protocol
parameters.

The Internet protocol suite, as defined by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) and its steering group (the IESG), contains numerous
parameters, such as internet addresses, domain names, autonomous
system numbers (used in some routing protocols), protocol numbers,
port numbers, management information base object identifiers,
including private enterprise numbers, and many others.

The common use of the Internet protocols by the Internet community
requires that the particular values used in these parameter fields be
assigned uniquely.  It is the task of the IANA to make those unique
assignments as requested and to maintain a registry of the currently
assigned values.

Requests for parameter assignments (protocols, ports, etc.) should be
sent to <iana@isi.edu>.

Requests for SNMP network management private enterprise number
assignments should be sent to <iana-mib@isi.edu>.

The IANA is located at and operated by the Information Sciences
Institute (ISI) of the University of Southern California (USC).

If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the
use of a link, socket, port, protocol, etc., please contact the IANA
to receive a number assignment.

RFC 1700                    Assigned Numbers                October 1994


Most of the protocols are documented in the RFC series of notes.  Some
of the items listed are undocumented.  Further information on
protocols can be found in the memo, "Internet Official Protocol
Standards" (STD 1).

Data Notations

The convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols is to
express numbers in decimal and to picture data in "big-endian" order
[COHEN].  That is, fields are described left to right, with the most
significant octet on the left and the least significant octet
